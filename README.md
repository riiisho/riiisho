<h1>Hey, I'm Henry!<br/></h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>

I'm a college student who lives in the UK. I'm currently completing a Level 3 Extended Diploma in IT. I enjoy making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS and love learning new coding languages to push my abilities further.<br><br>
For my student projects, I usually upload to github once I make significant progress and it is coding based.
